    <h2>Sorry for the formatting:
        <br> Doing something like this involves a lot of initative and trying to do things by yourself, however, it is good to know where to start and the names of things!
        <br> Be warned! All of this take a lot of time and research!
        <br>
        <br> Online tutorials and documentation will become your best friend!
        <br> Of course, you can find some like minded people in the school coding club at B19 :) (yes I just advertised it)
        <br> 
        <br> The first step is to set up a GitHub account. GitHub is essentially a website allowing you to save your files online, acting as history control.
        <br> It comes with the feature of hosting a website, which is how I hosted this. You should do more research on this.
        <br>
        <br> Then, install an IDE. I used VS Code, which is very versatile. To use VS Code, install the appropriate extensions for JavaScript, Git Bash, HTML, CSS.
        <br> You should also install Git Bash and Git, which is what allows you to save things onto GitHub.
        <br>
        <br> Once you do that, you should learn to code in JavaScript and HTML, the key components for a website. CSS is another, but it is used exclusively for decorating a page.
        <br> To learn about how JavaScript works, you might want to learn a little about OOP syntax and general coding concepts.
        <br>
        <br> You should then learn to use the Git terminal and learn some file management, and create a repository on GitHub after you made your account.
        <br> Link and save all your files to your GitHub repository, and follow the steps to making a GitHub Page.
        <br> 
        <br> If you would like to see proof of all this happening, inspect the webpage for the game, or this one, and click "sources".
        <br> By clicking and opening files, you can see my horrible HTML code and formatting because I was too lazy to learn CSS and I'm on a deadline :P
