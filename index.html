    <h1>Before you begin, here are some things you should know:
        <ul>
            <li>This website looks horrible because it's made by a student, if you were wondering.</li>
            <li>You should only play in an area where you can focus on the game, such as at home or sat down on a bench.</li>
            <li>You should use a calculator or other tools to help you, including other people.</li>
            <li>Do not reload the game page. If you do, all progress will be lost.</li>
            <li>The game will take roughly 10-15 minutes.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>How to play the game:
        <br> The rules are simple: You are presented with an enemy, who has 10 different characteristics (stats). You have 60 seconds to make a choice.
        <br>
        <br> To gain points, you must choose the best option out of 10 available characters.
        <br> To determine the best option, simply add up all the stats of a character. You must account for any modifiers if present.
        <br> If your chosen character has more stats than the enemy, you gain points. Less, and you lose points.
        <br> The bigger the difference, the more points you gain / lose.
        <br>
        <br> If you go over 60 seconds when making your choice, you will go into overtime, but lose extra points.
        <br> 
        <br> Aim to have as many points as possible! The example UI is shown below. The game will start as soon as you click the link.
