    <h1>Before you begin, here are some things you should know:
        <ul>
            <li>This website looks horrible because it's made by a student with minimal web programming experience.</li>
            <li>This is a multiple choice style game and your input is wanted as part of a school science project.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Note that data is not needed after 19th August, 2025, but you're free to play this game.</li>
            <br>
            <li>You should only play in an area where you can focus on the game, such as at home or sat down on a bench.</li>
            <li>It would be preferred for you to play the game indoors or have your high screen brightness.</li>
            <li>You should NOT use a calculator or other tools to help you.</li>
            <li>Do not reload the game page. If you do, all progress will be lost.</li>
            <br>
            <li>At the end of the game, you will have to fill out a Google Forms survey and copy and paste text given to you (more on that at the end)</li>
            <br>
            <li>Do not play this game if you have sensitivity to colours or related medical conditions.</li>
            <li>You should expect the game to take roughly 7-10 minutes, and the survey to take 2. Please don't rush through it.</li>

    <h2>How to play the game:
        <br> The rules are simple: You are presented with an enemy, who has 10 different characteristics (stats). You have 60 seconds to make a choice.
        <br>
        <br> You must choose the best option out of 10 available characters.
        <br> To determine the best option, simply add up all the stats of a character. You must account for any modifiers if present.
        <br> If your chosen character has more stats than the enemy, you gain points. Less, and you lose points.
        <br>
        <br> If you go over 60 seconds when making your choice, you will go into overtime, but lose extra points on top of your result.
        <br> Once you finish a round, there will be a 4 second intermission, allowing you to take a small break.
        <br> 
        <br> Aim to have as many points as possible! The example UI is shown below. The game will start as soon as you click the link.
